## Heat Insert Guidance

- Press the threaded heat inserts into the parts with a ~220Â°C soldering iron (PLA). Please be patient when doing so and do NOT increase the temperature, as the parts may not be able to hold the threaded heat inserts if melted too much.
- Once the inserts are flush with the surrounding surface, remove the soldering iron and gently press down with a flat object (I used a metal ruler) to ensure it stays fully seated as the surrounding plastic solidifies.
