# Compact-Direct-Drive-Wheelbase
This open-source project is an open-source, low-budget DIY force feedback wheelbase project designed as an affordable and accessible solution for sim-racing enthusiasts.

## The project uses:
- [FFBeast](https://ffbeast.github.io/docs/en/wheel.html) as the controller firmware.
- An ODrive Mini as the electronic speed controller.
- A hoverboard motor as the drive system.
- A magnetic encoder installed inside the motor: [MT6835 (10,000 PPR)](https://github.com/mcells/mt6835-hoverboard-motor?tab=readme-ov-file) or [MT6701 (1024 PPR)](https://www.printables.com/model/934160-ffbeast-encoder-assembly)
- A compact housing for the components - all design files included.
